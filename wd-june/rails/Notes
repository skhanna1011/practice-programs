All models maps to db tables.
Controllers
Conductors of an MVC app.
Controllers accepts requests, perform the necessary processing and then pass control to view layer.
In response to a request, the controller typically performs a CRUD operation on the model, sets up variables to be used in the view, and then proceeds to render to another action after processing is complete.
Views

These templates take plain html and use Ruby to inject the data and view specific logic as needed.
